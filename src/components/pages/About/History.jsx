              (/kəˈrɑːti/; Japanese pronunciation: [kaɾate] ⓘ; Okinawan
              pronunciation: [kaɽati]), also karate-do (空手道, Karate-dō), is a
              martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the
              indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts (called te (手), "hand"; tī in
              Okinawan) under the influence of

              [1][2] While
              modern karate is primarily a striking art that uses punches and
              kicks, traditional karate also employs throwing and joint locking
              techniques.[3] A karate practitioner is called a karate-ka
              (空手家). <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              Ryukyu Kingdom had been conquered by the Japanese Satsuma Domain
              and had become its vassal state since 1609, but was formally
              annexed to the Empire of Japan in 1879 as Okinawa Prefecture. The
              Ryukyuan samurai (Okinawan: samurē) who had been the bearers of
              karate lost their privileged position, and with it, karate was in
              danger of losing transmission. However, karate gradually regained
              popularity after 1905, when it began to be taught in schools in
              Okinawa. During the Taishō era (1912–1926), karate was introduced
              to mainland Japan by Gichin

              popularity was initially sluggish with little exposition but when
              a magazine reported a story about Motobu defeating a foreign boxer
              in Kyoto, karate rapidly became well known throughout Japan.[4]

              Around the 1820s, Matsumura Sōkon (1809–1899) began teaching
              Okinawa-te.[50] Matsumura was, according to one theory, a student
              of Sakugawa. Matsumura's style later became the origin of many
              Shuri-te schools. <br /> Itosu Ankō (1831–1915) studied under
              Matsumura and Bushi Nagahama of Naha-te.[51] He created the 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinan" target="_blank" className="text-blue-950 font-semibold underline">

              </a>
              forms ("Heian" in Japanese) which are simplified kata for
              beginning students. In 1905, Itosu helped to get karate introduced
              into Okinawa's public schools. These forms were taught to children
              at the elementary school level. Itosu's influence in karate is
              broad. The forms he created are common across nearly all styles of
              karate. His students became some of the most well-known karate
              masters, including Motobu Chōyū, Motobu Chōki, Yabu Kentsū,
              Hanashiro Chōmo,
